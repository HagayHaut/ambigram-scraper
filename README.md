# Ambigram Generating CLI

Made with the [Beautiful Soup]() python library for web scraping and the [Make Ambigrams](https://makeambigrams.com/ambigram-generator/) generator.

## !! In Progress !!

Idea is for user to input a word/sentence and a filename, and the CLI will generate a file in the current directory containing image of ambigram of the given word/sentence.

## Expected Use:

From within the directory you wish to store the file, run:  
```
python ambigram_scraper jawn
```
This cool ambigram with the filename `jawn.png` will be downloaded
